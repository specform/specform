# Deprecated

This repository previously contained development for the TypeScript and Go SDKs used by the Specform platform.

As of 4th July, 2024 both SDKs have been moved to standalone repositories for better modularity and release management:

- ðŸŸ¨ Go SDK â†’ [github.com/specform/go-sdk](https://github.com/specform/go-sdk)
- ðŸŸ¦ TypeScript SDK â†’ [github.com/specform/ts-sdk](https://github.com/specform/ts-sdk)

---

## Current Status

This repository is no longer actively maintained. It remains public only for historical reference and to support past Go module versions.

If you are using any of the SDKs from this monorepo:

- Please update your `go.mod`, `package.json`, and import paths to use the standalone SDKs.
- Do **not** rely on the old SDK paths or pseudo-versions going forward.
